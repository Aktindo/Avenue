# Avenue
Hey there! Wanna make a bot that has all the features you need, well then you are in the right place. Avenue is a project that I will work on over the months in my spare time. So, if you need any help, you can take a look at the source code and understand where and what you are missing in your code.

# Installation
To successfully clone this repo, you can do `git clone <repo_url>`.
After that, you can run `npm i` in your console or terminal which should install all the required dependecies. Once you have done that too, make a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and set the content to 
```env
TOKEN=your token here
MONGO_URI=your mongodb url
CLIENT_ID=your bot id
SECRET=your bot's secret
DASHBOARD_URL=your dashboard url
SYSTEM_METRIC_APIKEY=your system metric api key
SYSTEM_METRIC_PAGEID=your system metric page id
SYSTEM_METRIC_METRICID=your system metric id
```
And then you can simply run `node index.js` in the terminal and the bot should be online!
Incase of any errors, please join the support server. This will be improved over time!
